A little tool to make rapid prototyping/saving images easy with git integration.

## This won't work for you :)

Not Yet....

1. Swap the ShareX app config, to export the images in the project's output folder.
2. Also, generate a name and use that for the shareX config (while shareX can do thsi by itself, it's not possible to pull the name genrated by shareX)
3. git add && commit
4. vercel push if --d is preset.

## ShareX

Need to install it from shareX

- Create a workflor to take videos/videos.
- Pass that workflow name to me
- Install vercel globally with npm ()
